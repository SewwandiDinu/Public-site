            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               Due to interaction with biological risk factors, the number of people worldwide who experience developmental delays is increasing. 
               There are often sufficient early detection services available in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Through the analysis of 
               developmental abnormalities in children throughout several periods, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can discern 
               trends about increases, decreases, or stability in the numbers. Comparisons of developmental disability rates between different demographic0
                groups and geographical regions are also made possible by this data-driven method. According to the global estimation, there are 52.9 million 
                children under the age of five suffering from developmental delays. 95% of children live in low and middle-income countries. When they don't 
                have enough assistance or a supportive environment, children with developmental delays frequently face significant challenges in taking advantage 
                of possibilities. For many families and children with developmental impairments, getting support services presents additional problems. These 
                omparisons can be made between youngsters of different racial and ethnic backgrounds as well as gender disparities between boys and girls. 
                When a small kid doesn't meet developmental milestones at a pace that is like that of their peers in the same community, it indicates a delay 
                in development. Impairment in distinct domains, such as gross motor, fine motor, hearing, speaking and listening, and social behavior, causes 
                this phenomenon. Due to the lack of awareness from their parents and caregivers in developing countries like Sri Lanka, many of these cases 
                still need to be diagnosed. The “Kids Progress” mobile application is introduced to identify the mentioned developmental delays.

                  The methodology for the "Kid Progress" mobile application, designed to identify developmental delays in children aged 3 to 5, involves a systematic approach that incorporates the evaluation of four key developmental domains: gross motor skills, fine motor skills, hearing, speaking and listening abilities, and social behavior and play skills. This comprehensive assessment is achieved through a combination of parent and caregiver input, video uploads, and automated analysis using advanced machine learning techniques.

                  The gross motor skills assessment focuses on two specific activities: walking on tiptoe and climbing up and down stairs. These activities were selected because they provide clear indicators of a child's balance, coordination, and overall motor abilities. Parents and caregivers are asked to capture videos of the child performing these activities in a natural setting without any coercion. The video upload feature of the mobile application ensures that these activities can be recorded and reviewed multiple times, allowing for a thorough and consistent evaluation process.

                  For fine motor skills, the application includes two key activities: identifying hand-drawn shapes and building structures with toy bricks. These tasks are designed to assess the child's ability to manipulate small objects and understand visual shapes, which are critical components of fine motor development. Similar to the gross motor assessment, videos of the child engaging in these activities are uploaded to the application for analysis.

                  The evaluation of social behavior and play involves activities such as brushing teeth and dressing without guidance. These activities were chosen because they reflect a child's ability to perform daily routines independently, which is an important aspect of social development. The application uses the YOLO V8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection algorithm to analyze the uploaded videos and accurately assess the child's performance in these tasks.

                  To assess hearing, speaking, and listening abilities, the application includes a counting test where the child is prompted to count from 1 to 10 with background voice guidance. Parents or caregivers record the child's voice as they count, and the application converts the recorded numbers into text. The application then evaluates the correctness of the counted numbers, providing a clear indicator of the child's numerical understanding and verbal articulation.

                  Throughout this process, the application emphasizes the importance of a stress-free and natural environment for the child. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to allow the child to perform the activities without pressure, ensuring that the recorded videos accurately reflect the child's true abilities. By combining video analysis with parent-reported data, the "Kid Progress" application aims to provide a reliable and comprehensive assessment of developmental delays, supporting early intervention and personalized care strategies for young children.

               Identifying developmental delays in children aged 3 to 5 years old is crucial for early intervention, but traditional methods of assessment often require specialized training, are time-consuming, and may not be accessible to all families. Many parents and caregivers lack the tools and expertise to accurately monitor and assess their child's developmental progress in everyday settings, leading to delays in recognizing and addressing potential developmental issues. The challenge is to develop an accessible, user-friendly, and accurate method for parents and caregivers to assess their child's developmental milestones across various domains at home.

               The "Kid Progress" mobile application offers an innovative solution by leveraging technology to facilitate the identification of developmental delays in children aged 3 to 5 years. By integrating video upload functionality and advanced machine learning algorithms like YOLO V8, the app enables parents and caregivers to conduct comprehensive assessments of their child's gross motor, fine motor, hearing, speaking, listening, and social behavior skills in a natural and stress-free environment. The application guides users through specific activities designed to reveal developmental progress and potential delays, providing immediate feedback and analysis. This approach not only democratizes access to developmental assessments but also empowers parents with the tools to monitor their child's development continuously, ensuring timely interventions and personalized care.
